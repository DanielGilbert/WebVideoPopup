# WebVideoPopup #

This is a really simple Program for Windows, which allows you to play a YouTube-Video in a single window.

## Usage ##
Extract the zip-file from [the latest Release](https://github.com/DanielGilbert/WebVideoPopup/releases) to a directory of your choice. Make sure to extract everything!

Simply run with `WebVideoPopup.exe youtubeId` from console. E.g.:

`PS D:\WebVideoPopup>.\WebVideoPopup.exe oHg5SJYRHA0`

Make sure you don't add any `-` or `--` before the id. The id itself can be found in the URL of your Youtube video: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0` - the import part is the letter/number combination after `?v=`.

## Roadmap ##
This tool was build in less than 30 minutes. Maybe I'll enhance it further in the future.
